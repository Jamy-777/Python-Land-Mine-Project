This repository is for a Python project of mine which imports a dataset from UCI ML Repo (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/763/land+mines-1).
My project predicts if a mine is present in the soil or not, if yes then of what type.
I have used Streamlit for creating a web app and JobLib for exporting the best model based on the accuracy of the models I have used.
